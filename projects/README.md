# Writing Projects Directory

This directory is used by the writing agent to create and manage writing projects. The agent will help you organize and structure your writing projects, whether they are novels, short stories, scripts, or other creative writing endeavors.

## Structure

Each writing project will be created in its own subdirectory, containing:
- Manuscript files (in various formats like .md, .txt, .docx)
- Character profiles and development notes
- Plot outlines and story arcs
- Research materials and references
- World-building documentation
- Writing templates and guides
- Project-specific configuration

## Usage

The writing agent will help you:
- Set up new writing projects with appropriate structure
- Create and organize project files
- Manage different versions of your work
- Track progress and maintain consistency
- Provide writing templates and guidance

You can start a new writing project by asking the agent to create one for you. The agent will handle all the organization and file management, allowing you to focus on your writing.
