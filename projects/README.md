# Projects Directory

This directory is used by the writing agent to create and manage project files and folders for users. When you work with the agent, it will create new project directories here containing all the necessary files and structure for your writing projects.

## Structure

Each project will be created in its own subdirectory, containing:
- Project-specific files and folders
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Any other resources needed for the project

## Usage

The agent will automatically create and manage projects in this directory based on your requirements. You don't need to manually create or modify files here - the agent will handle all the organization and file management for you.
