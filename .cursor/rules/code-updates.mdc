# Code Updates and Maintenance Automation

## Overview
This rule automates the process of updating and maintaining code dependencies, tools, and environments across the project.

## Automation Principles
1. Agent Responsibility
   - Agent handles all automated tasks
   - No human intervention required for standard operations
   - Human only needed for:
     * Testing and validation
     * Critical security decisions
     * Production deployments
     * Custom requirements

2. Self-Sufficiency
   - Agent performs all routine updates
   - Agent handles error recovery
   - Agent manages rollbacks
   - Agent documents changes

3. Human Interaction
   - Only request human input when:
     * Testing is required
     * Security approval needed
     * Custom configuration requested
     * Critical errors occur

## Automated Steps
1. Environment Check
   - Verify system requirements
   - Check installed versions
   - Validate configurations

2. Dependency Updates
   - Update package managers (npm, pnpm, etc.)
   - Update project dependencies
   - Update development tools

3. Environment Updates
   - Update runtime environments
   - Update build tools
   - Update development environments

4. Configuration Updates
   - Update project configurations
   - Update environment variables
   - Update build settings

5. Verification
   - Run tests
   - Check compatibility
   - Validate functionality

## Implementation
The rule uses automated scripts to:
- Check and update system requirements
- Manage package dependencies
- Configure development environments
- Handle build processes
- Run verification tests

## Usage
To run updates:
1. Open terminal as Administrator
2. Navigate to project directory
3. Run appropriate update script:
   - `scripts/update-node.ps1` for Node.js updates
   - `scripts/update-deps.ps1` for dependency updates
   - `scripts/update-env.ps1` for environment updates

## Dependencies
- Administrative privileges
- Internet connection
- Required development tools
- Package managers

## Notes
- All updates are automated
- Progress is logged
- Rollback available
- Configuration backups created

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check system requirements
2. Verify network connection
3. Check error logs
4. Review update history
5. Check compatibility matrix

## Best Practices
1. Always backup before updates
2. Test in development first
3. Review changelogs
4. Check compatibility
5. Document changes

## Agent Behavior Guidelines
1. Proactive Automation
   - Take initiative to automate tasks
   - Don't ask for human input unless necessary
   - Handle errors automatically when possible

2. Human Interaction
   - Only request human input for:
     * Testing and validation
     * Security-critical decisions
     * Production deployments
     * Custom requirements
   - Provide clear context when human input is needed
   - Explain why human input is required

3. Error Handling
   - Attempt automatic recovery first
   - Document all error scenarios
   - Only escalate to human when:
     * Automatic recovery fails
     * Security is compromised
     * Data integrity is at risk
     * Custom intervention needed
